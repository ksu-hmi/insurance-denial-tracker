# Insurance Denial Tracker Application

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a web application designed to track, manage, and report insurance denials and appeals. The application is built with Python for back-end operations, MongoDB for data management, and a responsive Gradio web UI for user interaction.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the tracking of denial progress is manual and documented within patient charts. This approach is prone to loss, misplacement, and difficulty in comprehensive analysis. Additionally, while denial progress can be entered into the Electronic Health Records (EHR), notes are restricted to individual patient records, limiting the ability to query across patients for broader denial reports.

## Solution

The Insurance Denial Tracker Application aims to address these challenges by providing:

* **Centralized Denials Database:** A dedicated database to log all denials after a claim denial are received, eliminating reliance on paper or scattered EHR notes.
* **Progress Tracking:** The ability to capture denial details upon receipt, add appeals as notes or other progress, and track the progress of each case over time.
* **Filter & Report:** Filtering options to easily identify outstanding denials based on various criteria, such as date of service, patient, or bill amount.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A modern and intuitive web interface accessible through any web browser.
* **Local Deployment:** The application can be deployed directly on a local server for centralized and shared access to every computer in the local network.

## Key Functionalities:

* **Centralized Claims Management:** Seamlessly input and record received insurance claim denials, eliminating reliance on scattered document management and facilitating efficient data retrieval.
* **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate insightful reports with granular filtering and sorting options based on pre-defined criteria (date of service, bill amount, paid amount, denials status).
* **User Roles:** While password encryption and cookie-based sessions are currently under development, the system already supports user roles (Guest, User, Admin ) for access management.
* **Administrative Privileges:** Admin users hold the authority to create and manage additional user accounts.

## Technology Stack

* **Front-End:** Gradio
* **Back-End:** Python
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Deployment:** Docker

A Python-based system for tracking, analyzing, and appealing insurance denials
# Insurance Denial Tracking System

## Overview
The Insurance Denial Tracking System is a Python-based project designed to help healthcare providers identify, track, and resolve claim denials. The system enables real-time tracking, analytics, and even generates appeal letters to reduce delays and revenue loss.

## Features
- Centralized logging of denied claims
- Categorization of denials (e.g., coding errors, lack of medical necessity)
- Predictive modeling for recurring denial patterns
- Automated appeal letter generation
- Task assignment for follow-up using AI logic
- Dashboard interface (Gradio or Flask-based)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- MongoDB
- Pandas
- Flask / Gradio
- GitHub (version control)
- Markdown (for documentation)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ksu-hmi/insurance-denial-tracker.git
cd insurance-denial-tracker
